# Netlify Deployment Guide - FIXED VERSION

## ✅ Issue Resolved!

The white page issue was caused by the Blink auto-engineer script in index.html. This script is now completely removed.

## 🚀 How to Deploy to Netlify:

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. **Download the `dist` folder** from your Blink project
2. **Go to Netlify.com** and log in
3. **Drag the entire `dist` folder** to the deployment area
4. **Your website will deploy successfully!**

### Method 2: Manual Upload
1. **Zip the `dist` folder contents** (not the folder itself, just the contents)
2. **Upload the zip file** to Netlify
3. **Deploy!**

## ✅ What's Fixed:
- ❌ Removed Blink auto-engineer script that was causing white page
