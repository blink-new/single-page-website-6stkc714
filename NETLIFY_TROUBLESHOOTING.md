# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting

## 🚨 Blank Page Issue - SOLVED!

If you're seeing a blank page after deploying to Netlify, here are the fixes we've implemented:

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

1. **SPA Routing**: Added proper redirects in `netlify.toml`
2. **Build Configuration**: Optimized Vite config for production
3. **Asset Paths**: Ensured all paths are relative and correct
4. **HTML Title**: Updated from "Blink App" to "Single Page Website"

### 🔧 **Deployment Steps:**

#### **Option 1: Manual Deploy (Recommended)**
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload the `dist` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Your site should work immediately!

#### **Option 2: Git Integration**
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will auto-build using our `netlify.toml` config

### 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for any errors in Netlify's build logs
2. **Browser Console**: Open DevTools and check for JavaScript errors
3. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear browser cache
4. **Check Assets**: Ensure `logo.png` and font files are in the `public` folder

### 📋 **Verification Checklist:**

- ✅ `dist` folder contains `index.html`
- ✅ `dist/assets` folder contains CSS and JS files
- ✅ `logo.png` is in the `public` folder
- ✅ Arabic fonts are included
- ✅ `_redirects` file is in `public` folder
- ✅ `netlify.toml` has proper redirect rules

### 🎯 **Expected Result:**

Your website should display:
- Arabic logo and branding
- "عوالي طويق" hero section
- Company information in Arabic
- Contact information: "تواصل معنا hello@awalituwiq.com"
- Responsive design on all devices

### 🆘 **Still Need Help?**

If the issue persists:
1. Check Netlify's build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
3. Test the build locally first with `npm run build && npm run preview`

The configuration is now optimized for Netlify deployment!
